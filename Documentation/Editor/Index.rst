   Localizer Modules

After the selector module has opened, you have to select a page from the page tree, since each translation process needs at least one page record to be working on.

#. Now you can select one of the available Localizers for your translation tasks. If there is only one, you can proceed to the next step without selecting one.
#. Now you can select one of the available Carts for your translation tasks. If you did not create one yet, you can create new cart now.
#. Now you can select one or more of the available Languages of that Localizer. Each selected language will at least create a translated page later on so leave those languages unchecked, that should not be translated at all.
#. Now you can select one or more of the translatable tables of the page you are working on.
#. If you have a large number of records on that page you can define a time frame to reduce the amount of records within the selector to the ones that have been created or changed within that time frame.
#. Now click on "Store" and you should see a matrix similar to the :ref:`figure1`
